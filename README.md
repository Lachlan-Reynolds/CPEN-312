Digital Systems and Microcomputers 

Third year engineering course taken by IGEN, FIZZ and Mecha students. 
Course Description:
Data representation in digital computers; boolean algebra; the design and optimization and implementation of combinatorial and sequential circuits; modern digital circuit technologies; memory and programmable logic devices; organization and operation of microcomputers; data/address bus organization; input-output interfacing. 

First half of the course (Digital Systems) is FPGA programming in VHDL using a DE0-CV board manufactured by Terasic. 
Second half the course (Microcomputers) emulates an Intel 8051 Microcontroller on the DE0-CV and involves programming it in Intel Assembly.
